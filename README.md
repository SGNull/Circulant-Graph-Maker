# Circulant-Graph-Maker
This is a circulant graph maker for our summer research project. The executable was made using pyinstaller so that anyone can run this program, not just those with python installed on their machine. However, if you do have python installed, you can just run the .py file. It's far faster, and allows you to make some basic adjustments to the graph by editing the variables at the top of the code.

The commit history is a little odd because I already had the code made when this repo was created, and Visual Studio Code did some weird things.
